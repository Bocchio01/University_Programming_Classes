# ME663 Computational Fluid Dynamics

This repository contains the assignments for the course ME663 Computational Fluid Dynamics taken during my exchange term at the University of Waterloo, Canada.

The course was about learning how CFD are performed and implemented at the code level via discretization of the governing equations and solving them using iterative methods.

The assignments were done in pure `C` for the main solvers and `Python` for the pre and post processing.

The assignments are as follows:

1. [Assignment 1](./Assignment1/README.md): Solving the well known **2D lid-driven cavity incompressible flow** problem using different convection schemes (UDS, Hybrid and QUICK).
2. [Assignment 2](./Assignment2/README.md): ...
