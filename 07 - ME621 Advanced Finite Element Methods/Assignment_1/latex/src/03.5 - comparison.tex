\subsection{Comparison for Px}
\label{subsec:comparison}

Now, it can be interesting to compare the results obtained with the different linearization/approximation described in the previous sections.
For simplicity, we will perform this type of error analysis only for the force $P_x = f(\vec{u})$, but conceptually it would be the same for the force $P_y = f(\vec{u})$.

Since the following discussion doesn't want to be a formal error analysis, we will not use any formal error measure, but we will simply plot the difference between the approximated / linearized solutions and the exact one, that is:

\begin{equation}
    z(u,v) = \text{Error}[P_x(u,v)] = P_{x,approximated/linearized}(u,v) - P_{x,exact}(u,v)
\end{equation}

In this way, the error analysis can be performed graphically, by plotting a 3D surface of the error in the space $(u,v,z)$.

Moreover, since all our linearized / approximated solutions were obtained in the neighborhood of the point $\vec{u} = \vec{0}$ (because of the hypothesis of small displacements), we will limit our plot to a domain
\footnote{At this point, the choice of domain size was made based on a pure intuition of the final value of the displacement}
of $(u,v) \in [-0.001, 0.001] \times [-0.001, 0.001]$.

As we can see, in the neighborhood of point $\vec{u} = \vec{0}$, the error is negligible for every linearization and/or approximations.

However, as we move away from the point $\vec{u} = \vec{0}$, the error increases.
In particular, we can see that the error introduced by the linearization decreases as we increase the order of the Taylor series expansion.
