\section{Methodology}

We will start by writing the equilibrium equations for the system.
We will further work on the equilibrium equations to obtain the force-displacement relationship.
Finally, we will solve the system of equations ${\vec{P}} = f({\vec{u}})$ to obtain the displacement of point B for a given load.

Notice that we will likely obtain a system of non-linear equations, which we will solve using the both Euler and Newton-Raphson methods.
We will also perform a linearization of the system to successively compare the results obtained with the linearized and the non-linearized system.

Even if the problem asked to produce a MATLAB code, we will first set up the system of equations in Mathematica, and then we will translate the code to MATLAB.
Mathematica is a more powerful tool for symbolic computation, and it will allow us to obtain the system of equations that can be easily updated in case of necessity (for example a different order of the Taylor series).
