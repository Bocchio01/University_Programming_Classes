\abstract{
  Given the increase amount of applications requiring precise timekeeping, the demand for high-performance and low-cost clock sources has grown significantly.
  The constraints over the size, weight, and power consumption of modern electronics have led to the development of \acrfull{mems} \& \acrfull{nems}.

  In this project, we aim to investigate a particular class of \acrshort{mems} composed by the \textit{\acrfull{csac}}.

  The focus will be mainly on the principles and the engineering of these devices, and their potential applications.
  By doing so, we will also underline the motivations behind the use of these devices, and how they differ from the traditional clock sources.
