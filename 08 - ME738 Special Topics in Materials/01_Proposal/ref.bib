  abstract  = {The combination of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) fabrication with atomic clocks has enabled a new generation of small, cheap, low-power devices. Since the proposal of chip-scale atomic clocks (CSACs) in 2002, the fields of MEMS-based atomic sensors and coherent population trapping (CPT) spectroscopy have progressed rapidly. This review gives an overview of microfabrication techniques used for CSACs, the fabrication and integration of the critical components. Furthermore, the performance of MEMS clocks is evaluated in terms of frequency stability and sensitivity to external parameters, size, and power consumption. The possibilities of reaching the final goal of a MEMS clock with a fractional frequency instability below 10âˆ’11 at 1h of integration in a package of volume 1cm3, consuming 30mW of power, are discussed. Finally, a broad field of advanced spectroscopic techniques, their advantages, and drawbacks for the improvement of CSACs are reviewed.}

  abstract       = {High frequency surface acoustic wave (SAW) technology offers many opportunities for aerospace applications in passive wireless sensing and communication. This paper presents the design, simulation, fabrication, and test of an L-band SAW resonator based on 128&deg; Y-X LiNbO3 substrate. The design parameters of SAW resonator were optimized by the finite element (FEM) method and the coupling-of-mode (COM) theory. Electron-beam lithography (EBL) technology was used to fabricate the submicron-scale of interdigital transducers (IDTs) and grating reflectors. The effects of some key EBL processes (e.g., the use of electron beam resist, the choice of metal deposition methods, the charge-accumulation effect, and the proximity-effect) on the fabrication precision of SAW devices were discussed. Experimentally, the LiNbO3-based SAW resonators fabricated using improved EBL technology exhibits a Rayleigh wave resonance peaks at 1.55 GHz with return loss about &minus;12 dB, and quality factor Q is 517. Based on this SAW resonator, the temperature and strain sensing tests were performed, respectively. The experimental results exhibit a well linear dependence of temperature/strain on frequency-shift, with a temperature sensitivity of 125.4 kHz/&deg;C and a strain sensitivity of &minus;831 Hz/&mu;&epsilon;, respectively.},

  abstract  = {Numerical modelling of MicroElectroMechanical Systems (MEMS) resonators is attracting increasing interest from the sensors community especially when the nonlinear regime is activated by challenging applications of the device. Here, the dynamic response of a double-ended tuning fork MEMS resonator is studied both in the linear and nonlinear regime. A one Degree Of Freedom (1 dof) model able to predict the frequency response of the device is proposed. Geometric and electrostatic nonlinearities are simulated through a Finite Element Method (FEM) and a Boundary Element Method (BEM) code, respectively. The total damping of the resonator is computed by taking into account both the thermoelastic and the nonlinear fluid contributions. Experimental measurements performed on a resonator fabricated in polysilicon through a commercial surface micromachining process, validate the proposed model showing a very good agreement with theoretical predictions.},

  abstract  = {Laboratory optical atomic clocks achieve remarkable accuracy (now counted to 18 digits or more), opening possibilities for exploring fundamental physics and enabling new measurements. However, their size and the use of bulk components prevent them from being more widely adopted in applications that require precision timing. By leveraging silicon-chip photonics for integration and to reduce component size and complexity, we demonstrate a compact optical-clock architecture. Here a semiconductor laser is stabilized to an optical transition in a microfabricated rubidium vapor cell, and a pair of interlocked Kerr-microresonator frequency combs provide fully coherent optical division of the clock laser to generate an electronic 22\&\#x00A0;GHz clock signal with a fractional frequency instability of one part in 1013. These results demonstrate key concepts of how to use silicon-chip devices in future portable and ultraprecise optical clocks.}
