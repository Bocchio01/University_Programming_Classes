\section{Future prospects}
\label{sec:future_prospects}

Our analysis of commercially available \acrshort{csac} has shown that with the current architecture there exist a limitation in terms of achievable stability vs. size, weight and power consumption.

In this section, we will discuss the future prospects of \acrshort{csac} technology, focusing on the motivations for the development of the \acrfull{ngcsacs} and the proposed solutions to overcome the current limitations.
