\section{Future prospects}
\label{sec:future_prospects}

So far, we have analyzed the commercial available \acrshort{csac} and observed how with the current architecture there exist a limitation in terms of achievable stability vs. size, weight and power consumption.

In this section, we will discuss the future prospects of \acrshort{csac} technology, focusing on the motivations for the development of next-generation \acrshort{csacs} and the proposed solutions to overcome the current limitations.
