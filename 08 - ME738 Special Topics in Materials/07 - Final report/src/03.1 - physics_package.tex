\subsection{Physics Package (PP)}
\label{subsec:physics_package}

The \acrfull{pp} is the core component of the \acrshort{csac}, where the atomic excitation and interrogation take place.

Its function is to compare the frequency of the local oscillator with the atomic transition frequency and generate a signal that measures the difference between the two.
From a logical point of view, a generic PP receive as input the local oscillator frequency, and generate as output an electric signal that is sent to the control loop.
Electric power to excite the atoms and thermal power to maintain a steady temperature are also provided to the PP to ensure proper operation.

One of the keys in the stability of a \acrshort{csac}, lies in the capacity of the PP to generate a stable and accurate source of energy required for the excitation of the atoms, which leads to a stable and accurate signal for the control loop.

As we have mentioned at the beginning of this section (Section \ref{sec:working_principles}), \acrshort{csacs} can be divided into two main families based on the atomic element they use and the operating principle they follow.
In the following subsections (Subsections \ref{sssec:MODR} \& \ref{sssec:CPT}), we will delve into the specific architecture for the PP of the two main families of \acrshort{csacs}, namely the one based on \acrfull{modr} and the one based on \acrfull{cpt}.
