Other fields that benefit from the \acrshort{csac} technology are telecommunications and space experiments industries.

In particular, the telecommunications industry relies on precise time information to synchronize the network and ensure high speed communication.
However, in case the GNSS signal became not available or the master clock fails, the network must be able to work autonomously for a certain amount of time.
In this case, \acrshort{csacs} can be used to provide up to a local area a temporary time reference until the master clock is restored.

Another field where \acrshort{csac} technology is employed are space experiments.
Some example of successfully deployed \acrshort{csacs} in space are the SPATIUM (Space Precision Atomic-clock Timing Utility Mission) and the SPHERES (Synchronized Position Hold, Engage, Reorient, Experimental Satellites) projects.
Both of them involved the use of \acrshort{csacs} to synchronize the satellites and/or to provide a precise time reference for the experiments while keeping size, weight, and power consumption low.
