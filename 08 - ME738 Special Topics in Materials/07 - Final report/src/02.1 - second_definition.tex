\subsection{Definition of the Second [s]}
\label{subsec:second_definition}

The Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM), which is one of the three organizations that define the International System of Units (SI), defines the Second as: \textit{the fixed numerical value of the $Cs$ frequency $\Delta \nu_{Cs}$, the unperturbed ground-state hyperfine transition frequency of the $^{133}Cs$ atom, to be $9.192.631.770$ when expressed in the unit $Hz$, which is equal to $s^{-1}$.}

This kind of definition was first adopted starting from the year 1967, when experimental work showed the accuracy and reproducibility of transition between two energy levels of an atom or a molecule.
The current definition was proposed and adopted starting from 2018, and it's also the basis of modern atomic clocks.
