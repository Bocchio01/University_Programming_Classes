\section{Applications}
\label{sec:applications}

As we have seen in Section \ref{sec:performances_and_limitations}, the performance of a \acrshort{csac} varies depending on multiple factors that modify the nominal behavior of the internal components and the overall functionality of the clock.

However, the possibility of choosing components with different characteristics and the flexibility of the design, allows \acrshort{csac} to be used in a wide range of applications.
In the following, we will give an overview of the main applications that relies on \acrshort{csac} technology highlighting the requirements and the role the clock has in the application.
Here, applications are listed in order of their impact on society, starting from the most commonly used to the most specialized ones.
