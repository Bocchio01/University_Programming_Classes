\section{Objective metrics for timekeeping devices}
\label{sec:objective_metrics}

Before diving into the core subject of \acrshort{csacs}, it's important to give some definitions and explain the key parameters that define the performance of these devices.
Those parameters will be used in Section \ref{sec:performances_and_limitations} as objective metrics to compare and highlight the major differences between various architecture of the clocks.
