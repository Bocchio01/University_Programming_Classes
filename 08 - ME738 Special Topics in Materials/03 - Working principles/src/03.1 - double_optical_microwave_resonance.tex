\begin{frame}{$^{87}Rb$ Reference Cell}

    At the heart of a MODR based CSAC, we find a $^{87}Rb$ reference cell.

            We can distinguish 3 phases:

            \begin{enumerate}
                \item<1-> Optical Pumping (Population Inversion)
                \item<2-> Microwave Excitation
                \item<3-> Optical Pumping (Interrogation)
            \end{enumerate}

        \end{column}

    \end{columns}

    \vspace{10pt}

    \only<1>{Ground state population $F=\ket{1}$ gets pumped to $F=\ket{2}$.}
    \only<2>{Microwave tuned at the atomic resonance frequency ($\approx 6.8$ GHz) brings part of the population back to $F=\ket{1}$.}
    \only<3>{
        Depending on the intensity of the transmitted radiation, \textbf{we can infer if the microwave frequency was on resonance or not}.

        In this case, given that one photon was able to go through the cell, we can infer that the microwave frequency was not in resonance.

\begin{frame}{Photodetection}

    At the end of the cell, a photodiode is used to measure the intensity of the transmitted radiation.

    Our target is to stay at the dip of the transmission curve.

    Other notable components are:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item $^{87}Rb$ Bulb: high frequency radiation source.
        \item $^{85}Rb$ Filter cell: because of overlapping hyperfine levels, it filters out the unwanted transitions frequencies from the lamp.
        \item Microwave cavity: enhances the interaction between radiation and atoms.
    \end{itemize}

    \vspace{10pt}

    In case of a MODR-based CSAC, we can recognize multiple problematic areas:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Power consumption: each component inside the physics package is usually oven controlled ($70\%$ of the total power consumption).
        \item Size: microwave cavity imposes a low limit ($L_{min} = \frac{c}{2f_{transition}} \approx 2.2cm$).
        \item Optical instabilities\footnotemark[1]: Stark shifts, Zeeman effects, internal wall gas collision.
    \end{itemize}
