\section{Local Oscillator}

\begin{frame}{Local Oscillator}

    Normally, the local oscillator in a CSAC is a quartz crystal oscillator (XO).

    There exist many versions of the XO, differentiated based on the environmental correction type applied to enhance stability:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item TCXO: Temperature Compensated Crystal Oscillator
        \item MCXO: Microcomputer Compensated Crystal Oscillator
        \item OCXO: Oven Controlled Crystal Oscillator
    \end{itemize}

    \textbf{At short time scales, the quartz crystal oscillator is the main source of instability} in a CSAC due to its phase noise.

    Here are some other problematic areas:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item High temperature sensitivity
        \item Power consumption (in case of temperature compensation or oven control)
        \item Aging and frequency drift
    \end{itemize}

    In the end, the choice of a local oscillator is a trade-off between stability and power consumption.
