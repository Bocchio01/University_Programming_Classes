# ME738 Special Topics in Materials

This repository contains the course materials for `ME738 Special Topics in Materials` at the University of Waterloo (CA).

The course was taught by [Dr. Mustafa Yavuz](https://uwaterloo.ca/mechanical-mechatronics-engineering/profile/myavuz) in the Winter 2024 term.

## Course project

The course included a project that was designed to give students the opportunity to better understand the concepts covered in the course (`Nano & Micro Electro-Mechanical Systems`), by doing research on a specific topic of our choice.

This repo contains all the documents and code related to my project, which was about `Designing with MEMS Oscillators`.

In particular, the following documents are included:

- [Project proposal](01%20-%20Proposal.pdf)
<!-- - [Final project report](./Final%20Project%20Report.pdf) -->
<!-- Vapour Cell technologies not very stable due to thermal alteraction  -->
<!-- Cold Athom tech much more stable but immature yet -->
