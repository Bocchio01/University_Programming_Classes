\begin{frame}{Seismic Methods \& Oil Exploration}

    Seismic or acoustic methods measure the travel times of the reflected or refracted waves detected by a series of geophones and are able to estimate the location and depth of the targets.

            A \textbf{precise timestamp is required} to measure the travel time of the waves.

            Seismic methods are used for oil exploration since they can estimate the location and depth of the oil reservoirs.

\begin{frame}{Role of CSAC}

    Small short \& medium drifts $\rightarrow$ no GNSS required for nodes synchronization.

    Low battery consumption $\rightarrow$ long-lasting measurements campaigns (weeks or months).
