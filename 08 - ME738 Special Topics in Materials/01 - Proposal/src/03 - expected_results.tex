\section{Expected Results}

The expected results of the project are mainly related to the knowledge acquired during the research process.

The choice of this topic was driven by the combination of personal interest in the field and potential link with the course content.
Especially when considering the engineering of the \acrfull{csac}, we will try to refer as much as possible to the principles explained in class.

The idea is to create a stronger bridge between the theoretical and the practical aspects of \acrshort{mems} and \acrshort{nems} devices by studying the specific case of the \acrshort{csac}.
