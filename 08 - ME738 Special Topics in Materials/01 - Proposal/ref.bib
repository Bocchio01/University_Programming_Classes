  abstract  = {The combination of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) fabrication with atomic clocks has enabled a new generation of small, cheap, low-power devices. Since the proposal of chip-scale atomic clocks (CSACs) in 2002, the fields of MEMS-based atomic sensors and coherent population trapping (CPT) spectroscopy have progressed rapidly. This review gives an overview of microfabrication techniques used for CSACs, the fabrication and integration of the critical components. Furthermore, the performance of MEMS clocks is evaluated in terms of frequency stability and sensitivity to external parameters, size, and power consumption. The possibilities of reaching the final goal of a MEMS clock with a fractional frequency instability below 10âˆ’11 at 1h of integration in a package of volume 1cm3, consuming 30mW of power, are discussed. Finally, a broad field of advanced spectroscopic techniques, their advantages, and drawbacks for the improvement of CSACs are reviewed.}
