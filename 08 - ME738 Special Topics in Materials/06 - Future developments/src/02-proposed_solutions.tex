\section{Proposed solutions}

\begin{frame}{Proposed solutions}

    One of the most evident cause of instability and inaccuracy in CSACs is the Doppler broadening of the atomic transitions and the collisional shifts happening in the reference cell.

    \vspace{10pt}

    To reduce these effect and improving clock performances, three possible solutions are being investigated:

    \begin{itemize}
        \item Microwave transitions in a laser-cooled alkali metals
        \item Microwave transitions in double-resonance trapped ions
        \item Optical transitions in warm atomic/molecular vapors
    \end{itemize}
