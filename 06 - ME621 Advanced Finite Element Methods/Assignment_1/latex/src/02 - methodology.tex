\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

We will start by writing the equilibrium equations for the system.
We will further work on the \textbf{equilibrium equations to obtain the force-displacement relationship}.
Finally, we will solve the system of equations ${\vec{P}} = f({\vec{u}})$ to obtain the displacement of point B for a given load.

Notice that we will likely obtain a system of non-linear equations, which \textbf{we will solve using Euler, Newton-Raphson and modified Newton-Raphson methods}.
We will also perform a linearization and an approximation of the system to successively compare the results obtained with the exact solution.

Even if the problem asked to produce a \texttt{MATLAB} code, we will first set up the system of equations in \texttt{Mathematica}, and then we will translate the code to \texttt{MATLAB}.
\texttt{Mathematica} is a more powerful tool for symbolic computation, and it will allow us to obtain a system of equations that can be easily updated in case of necessity (for example if we are interested in a different order of the Taylor series).
