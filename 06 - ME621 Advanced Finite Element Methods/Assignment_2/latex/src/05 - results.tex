\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:final_displacement} we can observe a comparison between the situation in which the initial load is $F_{initial} = 0$ and linearly increased till $F_{final} = 1000kN$, and the situation in which $F_{initial} = F_{final} = 1000kN$.

In both the situation we can appreciate how the inertia of the bar is able to absorb the initial load.
