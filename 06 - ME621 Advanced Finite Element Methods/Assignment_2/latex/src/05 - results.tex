The numerical results for the problem described in Section \ref{sec:requests} are reported in the following.

    \label{fig:final_displacement}
\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:final_displacement} we can observe the displacement of the right end of the bar as a function of time for different values of the initial load $F_{initial}$.
In particular, as also the legend suggests, the plot represents:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Blue curve: $F_{initial} = 0$, $F_{final} = 1000kN$ (linearly increased with respect to time)
    \item Orange curve: $F_{initial} = F_{final} = 1000kN$ (constant)
\end{itemize}

As we can see, given the non-zero inertia of the bar, in both cases the rate of change of the displacement at the beginning is almost zero.

After the very beginning of the simulation, we can observe how the displacement of the right end of the bar starts to increase.
In particular, given the different applied loads, we have:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Blue curve: the displacement never reaches a point where the rate of change is constant in time, as the load is constantly increasing.
    \item Orange curve: the displacement reaches a point where its rate of change is constant in time, as the load is constant. This means that displacement became linear or almost linear in time.
\end{itemize}
