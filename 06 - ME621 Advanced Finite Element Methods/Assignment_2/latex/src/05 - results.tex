\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

The numerical results for the problem described in Section \ref{sec:requests} are reported in the following.

\begin{figure}[H]

    \label{fig:final_displacement}
\end{figure}

In Figure \ref{fig:final_displacement} we can observe the displacement of the right end of the bar as a function of time for different values of the initial load $F_{initial}$.
In particular, as also the legend suggests, the plot represents:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Blue curve: $F_{initial} = 0$, $F_{final} = 1000kN$ (linearly increased with respect to time)
    \item Orange curve: $F_{initial} = F_{final} = 1000kN$ (constant)
\end{itemize}

It's easy to see the different behavior of the two cases.

The application of a linearly increasing load (so without discontinuities at the beginning) leads to a displacement that is almost linear in time.
The small oscillation behavior is due to inertia and discretization of the mass distribution along the bar.

On the other hand, the application of a constant load (but with a strong discontinuity at the beginning) leads to a displacement that is definitively not linear (or constant) in time.
The oscillatory behavior is dominant with respect to the previous case and the increasing trend is not as clear as before.


\paragraph{Displacement along the bar}

Another interesting metrics to analyze is the displacement along the bar at different times.

In particular, from Figures \ref{fig:displacement_F0} \& \ref{fig:displacement_F1000} we can observe the displacement of the structure node of the bar at $7$ different times with different loads applied.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{img/displacement_F0.png}
    \caption{Displacement of the nodes at different times when $F_{initial} = 0 kN$}
    \label{fig:displacement_F0}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{img/displacement_F1000.png}
    \caption{Displacement of the nodes at different times when $F_{initial} = 1000 kN$}
    \label{fig:displacement_F1000}
\end{figure}

Also from these plots, we can observe the different behavior of the system when different loads are applied.

In case of $F_{initial} = 0 kN$, the displacement is almost linear both in time and in space (displacement lines increase linearly from left to right and from bottom to top).

In case of $F_{initial} = 1000 kN$, the displacement is not linear neither in time nor in space (displacement lines at different times intersects each other which means that the displacement of a given node is not monotonically increasing with time even if the applied load is unidirectional).
This behavior can be explained by the combination of the inertia of the system and the discontinuity in the applied load (wave propagation phenomenon).
