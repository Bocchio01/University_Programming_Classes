\subsection{Global matrices}
\label{subsec:global_matrices}

For the formulation of the FEM problem, we will need to compute the global matrices and vectors.

So far we have computed the elemental matrices in terms of the local coordinates system $\xi$.
We can now proceed to assemble the global matrices and vectors.

\paragraph{Connectivity matrix}

The assembly of the global matrices and vectors is performed by looping over all the elements and adding the contribution of each element to the corresponding global matrix or vector.
We can use the \textbf{connectivity matrix} to map the local degrees of freedom to the global degrees of freedom.

The connectivity matrix is also called Gather Scatter matrix and is defined as follows:

\begin{equation}
    L_{ij} =
    \begin{cases}
        1 & \text{if the i-th global degree of freedom is associated with the j-th local degree of freedom} \\
        0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

We can also express the connectivity matrix for a given element using the Kronecker delta function as follows:

\begin{equation}
    L_{ij}^e = \delta_{i,j} =
    \begin{cases}
        1 & \text{if } j = (m-1)(e-1) + 1 \\
        0 & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

Where $m$ is the number of nodes per element and $e$ is the element index.
With a bit of algebra, we can state that the $L$ matrix has a size of $m \times n$ where $n$ is the number of global degrees of freedom ($n = lenght(u_{nodal})$).

\paragraph{Assembly of the global matrices}

Having defined the connectivity (or assembly) matrix, we can now proceed to assemble the global matrices and vectors.

To do so, we will loop over all the elements and add the contribution of each element to the corresponding global matrix or vector.
This concept can be expressed using the gather equation:

\begin{align}
    f_{global} & = \sum_{e=1}^{n_{el}} L^{eT} f^e     \\
    M_{global} & = \sum_{e=1}^{n_{el}} L^{eT} M^e L^e
\end{align}

Where $L^e$ is the connectivity matrix for the $e-th$ element, and $f^e$ and $M^e$ are the elemental force vector and mass matrix, as computed in Equation \ref{eq:elemental_matrices}.
