\subsection{Global matrices}
\label{subsec:global_matrices}

Global matrices are obtained by assembling the elemental matrices based on the \texttt{connectivity matrix} generated during the mesh generation phase.

In particular, given that $f_{int}^e$, $f_{ext}^e$, $M^e$ have been computed using voigt notation, we can assemble the global matrices knowing that each row and columns of the global matrices correspond to a particular degrees of freedom of the system.
By summing for each element the contribution of the elemental matrices to the corresponding positions of the global matrices, we obtain the global matrices.
