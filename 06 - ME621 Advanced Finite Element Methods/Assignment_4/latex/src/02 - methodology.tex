To solve the given problem, we will build our code algorithm on top of the one developed for the previous assignment.

In particular, inside our Updated Lagrangian Formulation, we will check if the current configuration is in the elastic or plastic regime, and we will update the stress and strain tensors accordingly:

\begin{itemize}
    \item If the current strain is below the yield strain, we will update the stress tensor using the constitutive model for the elastic regime.
    \item If the current strain is above the yield strain, we will update the stress tensor using the constitutive model for the plastic regime.
\end{itemize}

In the plastic region, we will neglect any hardening due to kinematic and will assume the material to follow the isotropic hardening model.
