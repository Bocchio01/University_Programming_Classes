# Informatica B (a.k.a. Computer Science entry level)

This was just a brief introduction to basic programming concepts.
Some code here is at a very beginner level.

The repo files are split into two folders:

- [C](./C) contains the code written in C
- Matlab contains the code written in Matlab

However, since the code in the Matlab folder was super messy and not well organized, I simply decided to ignore and not upload it here on GitHub.

During the last part of the course we had the opportunity to compete in an internal coding competition, where we had to create a country flag using Matlab. The flag I created is the one below:

<div align="center">

<figcaption>Canada flag created using Matlab</figcaption>
</div>
