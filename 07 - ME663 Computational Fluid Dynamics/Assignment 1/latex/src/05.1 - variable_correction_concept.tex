\subsection{Variable Correction Concept}
\label{subsec:variable_correction_concept}

Before presenting the \acrshort{scgs} method itself, it's now useful to introduce the concept of variable correction, which is crucial for the understanding of the method.

The idea here is to observe a generic current state of the system $\phi^{(n)}$, as the sum of a known part $\phi^{(n-1)}$ and a correction $\delta \phi^{(n)}$:

\begin{equation}
    \phi^{(n)} = \phi^{(n-1)} + \delta \phi^{(n)}
    \label{eq:variable_correction_concept}
\end{equation}

Where $\phi$ is a generic variable, and $n$ is the iteration index.

For simplicity of notation, we will drop the iteration index in the following, and we will rewrite Equation \ref{eq:variable_correction_concept} as:

\begin{equation}
    \phi = \phi^* + \phi'
    \label{eq:variable_correction_concept_simplified}
\end{equation}

Where $\phi^*$ is the known part, and $\phi'$ is the correction.

By doing so, we can rewrite the state of the system at the current iteration as:

\begin{align}
    u_{i,j} & = u_{i,j}^* + u_{i,j}' \\
    v_{i,j} & = v_{i,j}^* + v_{i,j}' \\
    p_{i,j} & = p_{i,j}^* + p_{i,j}'
    \label{eq:variable_corrections}
\end{align}
