\subsection{Diffusion Schemes}
\label{subsec:diffusion_schemes}

In this section, we will present the schemes related to the diffusion terms of the discretized governing equations, which were derived in Section \ref{subsec:application_of_the_finite_volume_method}.

The general idea here is to approximate the diffusion term using its Taylor expansion and then evaluate the derivative at the cell faces.
As a recall, the definition of the Taylor expansion of order $n$ is:

\begin{equation}
    f(x) = f(x_0) + f'(x_0)(x - x_0) + \frac{f''(x_0)}{2!}(x - x_0)^2 + \dots + \frac{f^n(x_0)}{n!}(x - x_0)^n + \mathbf{O}((x - x_0)^{n+1})
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{$2^{nd}$-order scheme}

The $2^{nd}$-order scheme approximate the diffusion term using the Taylor expansion up to the second order.

We can start by writing the polynomial that approximates by interpolation the values of the variable $u$ at the cell faces.
To do so, we can use the Lagrange interpolation polynomial, previously defined in Equation \ref{eq:langrange_interpolation_polynomial}.
Since we are now analyzing the $2^{nd}$-order scheme, we will use $n = 2+1 = 3$ points to interpolate.

As before, we can use \texttt{Mathematica} to obtain the polynomial that approximates function $u(x)$ as:

\begin{equation}
    u(x) \approx \frac{2 (\Delta x)^2 u_{P}+x^2 (u_{E}-2 u_{P}+u_{W})+\Delta x x (u_{E}-u_{W})}{2 (\Delta x)^2}
\end{equation}

We can now proceed by evaluating the second derivative of the polynomial as:

\begin{equation}
    \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} \approx \frac{u_{E} - 2 u_{P} + u_{W}}{(\Delta x)^2}
\end{equation}

And finally, we can the approximated second derivative at the point of interest $x = 0$ as:

\begin{equation}
    \left. \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} \right|_P \approx \frac{u_{E} - 2 u_{P} + u_{W}}{(\Delta x)^2}
\end{equation}

Given the definition of the diffusion term of $u$ along $x$ in Equation \ref{eq:INS_steady_2D_discretized_diffusion}, we can write the $2^{nd}$-order scheme as:

\begin{equation}
    \nu \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} = \nu \frac{u_{E} - 2 u_{P} + u_{W}}{(\Delta x)^2}
\end{equation}

With a similar approach, we can obtain the $2^{nd}$-order scheme for the $y$ direction as:

\begin{equation}
    \nu \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} = \nu \frac{u_{N} - 2 u_{P} + u_{S}}{(\Delta y)^2}
\end{equation}

The same procedure can be applied to the $v$ momentum equation, obtaining the following results:

\begin{gather}
    \nu \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \nu \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} = \\
    \frac{\Delta y \nu  (u_{E}-2 u_{P}+u_{W})}{\Delta x} + \\
    \frac{\Delta x \nu  (u_{N}-2 u_{P}+u_{S})}{\Delta y}
\end{gather}

Since we are interested in the $A_P^\phi$ and $A_{nb}^\phi$ coefficients as written in the form of Equation \ref{eq:coefficients_form_system}, with the help of \texttt{Mathematica}, we can regroup the terms based on the velocity components, perform some sign manipulations and obtain the coefficients for the diffusion term using the $2^{nd}$-order scheme for both the $u$ and $v$ momentum equations.

\begin{equation}
    \text{Diffusion Coefficients order} 2^{nd} = { \textbf{See table \ref{tab:Ap_coefficients}} }
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{$4^{th}$-order scheme}

The $4^{th}$-order scheme approximate the diffusion term using the Taylor expansion up to the fourth order.

Since the reasoning is similar to the $2^{nd}$-order scheme, we can directly write the approximated second derivative at the point of interest $x = 0$ as:

\begin{equation}
    \left. \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} \right|_P \approx -\frac{u_{WW} - 16 u_{W} + 30 u_{P} - 16 u_{E} + u_{EE}}{12 (\Delta x)^2}
\end{equation}

Given the definition of the diffusion term of $u$ along $x$ in Equation \ref{eq:INS_steady_2D_discretized_diffusion}, we can write the $4^{th}$-order scheme as:

\begin{equation}
    \nu \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} = \nu -\frac{u_{WW} - 16 u_{W} + 30 u_{P} - 16 u_{E} + u_{EE}}{12 (\Delta x)^2}
\end{equation}

With a similar approach, we can obtain the $4^{th}$-order scheme for the $y$ direction as:

\begin{equation}
    \nu \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} = \nu -\frac{u_{WW} - 16 u_{W} + 30 u_{P} - 16 u_{E} + u_{EE}}{12 (\Delta y)^2}
\end{equation}

The same procedure can be applied to the $v$ momentum equation, obtaining the following results:

\begin{gather}
    \int_{V} \nu \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \nu \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} \space dV = \\
    -\frac{\nu}{12}  \left(\frac{u_{WW} - 16 u_{W} + 30 u_{P} - 16 u_{E} + u_{EE}}{(\Delta x)^2} + \frac{u_{WW} - 16 u_{W} + 30 u_{P} - 16 u_{E} + u_{EE}}{(\Delta y)^2} \right) \Delta x \Delta y
\end{gather}

Since we are interested in the $A_P^\phi$ and $A_{nb}^\phi$ coefficients as written in the form of Equation \ref{eq:coefficients_form_system}, with the help of \texttt{Mathematica}, we can regroup the terms based on the velocity components, perform some sign manipulations and obtain the coefficients for the diffusion term using the $4^{th}$-order scheme for both the $u$ and $v$ momentum equations.

\begin{equation}
    \text{Diffusion Coefficients order } 4^{th} = { \textbf{See table \ref{tab:Ap_coefficients}} }
\end{equation}
