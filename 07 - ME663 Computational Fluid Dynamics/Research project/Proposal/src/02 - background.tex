What's has been done so far regarding the development of innovative fuel injection system.

\begin{itemize}
    \item Understanding the combustion process in internal combustion engines.
    \item Optimizing the fuel injection system to improve the combustion process.
    \item We have always focused on the development of fuel injectors that can handle traditional fuels (gasoline, diesel, etc). They are easy to ignite allowing for an easier design process.
    \item The use of modern CFD simulations, supported by more powerful computers and experimental data to validate the simulations, may allow us to increase the precision of the modelling and opening the possibility of difficult-to-ignite fuels (such as Ammonia).
\end{itemize}
