\section{Preliminary Results}
\label{sec:preliminary_results}

A preliminary result would be about a rough estimation of a possible design of the fuel injector.

This implies to have a deep understanding of the chemical and physical properties of the alternative fuels and their combustion process.
Given that we don't have such a background in chemistry, nor we have the capability to perform a real CFD simulation, we can only try to replicate the results of the current state of the art just to have a starting point for our research.
