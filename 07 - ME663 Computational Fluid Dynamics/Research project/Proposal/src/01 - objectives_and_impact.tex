\section{Objectives and Impact}
\label{sec:objectives_and_impact}

Explain the objectives of the project and the expected impact of the research:

\begin{itemize}
    \item We need to develop new mechanical components that can handle these alternative fuels.
    \item CFD simulations are probably the most efficient and cost-effective way to develop new fuel injectors (one of the missing components needed to use alternative fuels in existing engines).
    \item The impact of this research, in case of positive results in the feasibility study, would be huge. The possibility of using Ammonia for example, would be a game changer in the industry.
\end{itemize}
