\section{Research Plan and Methodology}
\label{sec:research_plan_and_methodology}

The research plan is divided into three main stages:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Feasibility study: supposing that we will be able to design a fuel injector with no constraints, are those alternative fuels feasible to be used in internal combustion engines? What are their characteristics when it comes to ignite them under a controlled environment? $\rightarrow$ Understand the chemical and physical properties of the alternative fuels and their combustion process.
    \item Design and development of the fuel injector: based on the results of the feasibility study, modelling and simulation of diverse fuel injectors designs. $\rightarrow$ Use CFD simulations to optimize the fuel injector design.
    \item Experimental validation: once the simulations are completed, we will build a prototype and test it in a controlled environment. $\rightarrow$ Compare the experimental results with the simulations. Eventually, rerun CFD simulations to improve the model (and the design).
\end{enumerate}
