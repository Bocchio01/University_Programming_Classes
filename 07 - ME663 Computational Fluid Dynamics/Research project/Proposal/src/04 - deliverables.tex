The research is focused on the development of a new fuel injector suitable for Ammonia, so that it can be retrofitted in existing ICEs.

The main deliverables of the research project are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item A CFD model that can accurately predict the characteristics of the spray of Ammonia in a non-reactive condition.
    \item A CFD model that can accurately predict the characteristics of the spray of Ammonia in a reactive condition.
    \item A first design/prototype of the new fuel injector suitable for Ammonia that can be retrofitted in existing ICEs.
\end{itemize}

If the research is successful, the impact would be huge as it would allow a fast transition from fossil fuels to Ammonia as a fuel for ICEs thus reducing the emissions of $\mathrm{CO_2}$.
