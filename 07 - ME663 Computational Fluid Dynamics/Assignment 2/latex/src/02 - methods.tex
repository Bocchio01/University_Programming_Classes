\subsection{Symbolic Analysis}

Most of the request for this assignment has been solved using symbolic analysis in \texttt{Mathematica}.

For each Q\#, the chunk of code used to solve that particular question is reported at the end of the section.

Here, we report the head of the \texttt{Mathematica} notebook where both $U$ and $F$ are initialized as symbolic variables.

\lstinputlisting[
    style=mathematica,
    language=Mathematica,
    caption=Initialization of symbolic variables in Mathematica.,
]{files/Initial.txt}

A full notebook can be found in the appendix section of this document (Section \ref{sec:appendix}).

\subsection{Code implementation}

The code implementation has been done in \texttt{MATLAB} for the sake of simplicity and coding speed with respect to the previous assignment where the code was implemented in \texttt{C11}.

However, we would like in the future to integrate the code in the codebase of the previous assignment, where both the SCGS and SIMPLE algorithms are currently implemented.

The most important part of the \texttt{MATLAB} code can be found in the appendix section (Section \ref{sec:appendix}), while the complete code can be found on GitHub at the following link: \url{https://github.com/Bocchio01/University_Programming_Classes/tree/master/07%20-%20ME663%20Computational%20Fluid%20Dynamics/Assignment%202}.
