\subsection{Application of the Finite Volume Method}
\label{subsec:application_of_the_finite_volume_method}

Having defined our working framework, we can now proceed to the application of the Finite Volume Method (FVM) to the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations \ref{eq:incompressible_navier_stokes_steady_2D}.

To do so, we start by giving the general integral form of the governing equations, and then proceed to the discretization of the convection, diffusion and source terms separately.

In particular, assuming from now on to have a Cartesian grid, with a uniform mesh spacing in both the $x$ and $y$ directions, the (FVM) reads as follows:




From now on, we will focus on the $x$ direction, given that the treatment for the $y$ direction is analogous.

The first step is to integrate the governing equations over each control volume.

Our discretized set of equations will be:

\begin{align}
    % TODO Check if the equation is correct
    \int_{V} u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} dV + v \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} dV - \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} dV - \nu \left( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} \right) dV - f_x dV = 0 \\
    \int_{V} u \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} dV + v \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} dV - \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial p}{\partial y} dV - \nu \left( \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial y^2} \right) dV - f_y dV = 0
\end{align}

We can now proceed to the discretization of the convection, diffusion and source terms separately.

The rest of the treatment will be done considering just the $x$ direction, given that the treatment for the $y$ direction is analogous.

Our starter equation is:

\begin{equation}
    \int_{V} \underbrace{u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + v \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}}_{\text{Convection term}} - \underbrace{\frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} dV}_{\text{Pressure term}} - \underbrace{\nu \left( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} \right) dV}_{\text{Diffusion term}} - \underbrace{f_x dV}_{\text{Source term}} = 0
    \label{eq:inc_navier_stokes_steady_2D_discretized_x}
\end{equation}

Before proceeding, we need to define the control volume and the control volume faces geometrically.
