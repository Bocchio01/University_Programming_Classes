\section{Schemes}
\label{sec:schemes}

In this section, we will present the schemes used to solve the previously quasi-discretized equations \ref{eq:INS_steady_2D_discretized_convection} and \ref{eq:INS_steady_2D_discretized_diffusion}.

Those schemes are the "tools" that will allow us to bind the currently considered cell values with its neighbor's cell values.
This means that at the end of this section, we will have a set of coefficients (based on the scheme adopted) that will be used to assemble the solving matrix of the system.

To further clarify, what we want to achieve is to compute the following functions ($nb$ indicates a generic neighbor cell, one or more cells away from the current cell $P$):

\begin{align}
    u_P & = f(u_{nb}, v_{nb}, p_{nb}) \\
    v_P & = f(u_{nb}, v_{nb}, p_{nb})
\end{align}

As we will see, the result of the schemes will be a set of coefficients that will be used to compute the values of $u_P$ and $v_P$ based on the values of the neighbor cells.
In particular, the final form of the system will be:

\begin{align}
    A_P^u u_P & = \sum_{nb} A_{nb}^u u_{nb} + b_P^u \\
    A_P^v v_P & = \sum_{nb} A_{nb}^v v_{nb} + b_P^v
    \label{eq:coefficients_form_system}
\end{align}

Notice how there is no direct correlation between the $u$ and $v$ equations, that are instead coupled through the pressure term $p$.

Using the indices' notation system $(i,j)$ becomes:

\begin{align}
    (A_P^u)_{i,j} u_{i,j} & = \sum_{nb} (A_{nb}^u)_{i,j} u_{i,j} + (p_{i,j} - p_{i+1,j}) \Delta y \\
    (A_P^v)_{i,j} v_{i,j} & = \sum_{nb} (A_{nb}^v)_{i,j} v_{i,j} + (p_{i,j} - p_{i,j+1}) \Delta x
\end{align}

Similar to the approach used in the previous section, we will treat separately the convection and diffusion terms.
In this way we will obtain two different sets of coefficients, one for the convection term and one for the diffusion term.
Those coefficients will be then reassembled together to reduce the equations to the final form presented above.

In particular, we will have that the coefficients $A_P^\phi$ and $A_{nb}^\phi$ will be the difference between the convection and diffusion coefficients, given that from Equation \ref{eq:FVM_momentum_x_direction}, we know:

\begin{equation}
    FVM_{\text{Convection}} - FVM_{\text{Diffusion}} = 0 \rightarrow (A^\phi) = (A^\phi)_{\text{Convection}} - (A^\phi)_{\text{Diffusion}}
\end{equation}

\textbf{Note:} In the following sections, we will refer to the use of \texttt{Mathematica}.
The complete notebook used to obtain the final form of the coefficients is left in the \ref{sec:appendix} section of this document.
