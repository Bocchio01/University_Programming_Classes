\subsection{Comparison with Ghia's solution}
\label{subsec:comparison_with_ghia_solution}

Instead of just comparing the results by looking at the streamlines of the vector field which can be misleading, we are going to compare the velocity field at different points of the domain.
In particular, in Ghia's paper \cite{Ghia1982HighReSF} are reported the velocity profiles of $u(y) @ x/L_x = 0.5$ and $v(x) @ y/L_y = 0.5$ for different Reynolds numbers.

By using \texttt{MATLAB}, we can easily plot those profiles and compare them with the ones obtained using our code.

\textbf{Note:} to distinguish the different solutions generated by our code, we are going to use the following naming convention:

\begin{equation}
    \text{\#\#-Nx-Ny-Re-ConvectionScheme-DiffusionScheme-}\alpha_u\text{-}\alpha_v
\end{equation}

Where:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \#\# is the ID of the solution;
    \item $Nx$ is the number of points in the $x$ direction;
    \item $Ny$ is the number of points in the $y$ direction;
    \item $Re$ is the Reynolds number;
    \item $ConvectionScheme$ is the convection scheme used;
    \item $DiffusionScheme$ is the diffusion scheme used;
    \item $\alpha_u$ is the under-relaxation factor for the $u$ velocity (e.g. 08 for 0.8, 005 for 0.05, etc.);
    \item $\alpha_v$ is the under-relaxation factor for the $v$ velocity (e.g. 08 for 0.8, 005 for 0.05, etc.).
\end{itemize}

By benchmarking our code with different parameters, we have obtained the following velocity profiles.
