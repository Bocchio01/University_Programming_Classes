\section{Introduction}

This project has been chosen to further explore the content of the course ME663 - Computational Fluid Dynamics and to apply the knowledge acquired trying to finally answer a personal question of interest.

Given that for the first assignment we have successfully implemented a 2D solver for the Navier-Stokes equations using the \acrshort{scgs} algorithm, we would like to further explore the topic of \acrshort{cfd} solver by implementing in the same codebase the \acrshort{simple} algorithm and compare the results of the two.

Time and capabilities / resources permitting, the second part of the project will be to analyze the velocity field around a 2D geometry (external flow), using the \acrshort{simple} algorithm just implemented.

This study, is related to the author's interest in the problem of: \emph{Investigating the distribution of flow velocity around a pillar during windy conditions to enhance personal comfort by determining the optimal position that reduces wind exposure.}

Up to now, we think that the implementation of the \acrshort{simple} algorithm would be enough to be considered a personal project itself.
However, we believe that the addition of a complete velocity field analysis would make the project more interesting and challenging.

% For sure, we will implement the \acrshort{simple} algorithm, and we will try to analyze the temperature field around a 2D geometry.
% If we will not be able to complete the temperature field analysis, we will report the reasons and the difficulties encountered (along with the partial results) in the final report.
