\section{Expected Results}

The main expected result of the project is the implementation of the \acrshort{simple} algorithm.
We will report the mathematical derivation of the algorithm, the implementation details, and the results obtained for the Lid Driven Cavity problem in the same PDF report used also for the first assignment.

The second expected (and optional) result is the analysis of the velocity flow field around a 2D geometry.
We will report the results obtained considering different problem geometries and wind parameters (speed \& direction) in a separate PDF report.

Up to now, we don't have the competences to use a commercial \acrshort{cfd} software to compare our results with.
We would greatly appreciate it if the professor could provide us with some results obtained from such software for comparative analysis, if feasible.

In the end, we expect to have a better understanding of the \acrshort{cfd} solvers at least for 2D steady-state problems, and to be able to have a higher self-consciousness about their implementation and their limitations.
