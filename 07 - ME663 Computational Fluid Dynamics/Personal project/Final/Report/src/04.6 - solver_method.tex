\subsection{Solver method}
\label{subsubsec:solver_method}

The last step in the setup of the \texttt{Fluent} solver is to set the solver method.

Thanks to knowledge acquired during the course, at this phase we were able to take informed decisions and we opted for the following settings:

\begin{table}[H]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
        \hline
        \textbf{Parameter}       & \textbf{Value}      \\
        \hline
        Pressure-velocity scheme & Coupled             \\
        Momentum                 & Second Order Upwind \\
        \hline
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Solver method settings used.}
    \label{tab:solver_method}
\end{table}

All the other parameters were left to the default settings, which for most of spatial discretization or interpolations schemes were set to \textit{Second Order Upwind}.

A complete list of the settings used for the simulations is reported in the \texttt{XML} file in the Appendix \ref{sec:appendix}.
