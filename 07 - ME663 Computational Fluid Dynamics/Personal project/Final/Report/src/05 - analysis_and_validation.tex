\section{Analysis and validation of the results}
\label{sec:analysis_and_validation}

Finally, we can proceed with the validation of the results.

As previously mentioned in Section \ref{sec:methodology}, we are going to compare the results of the CFD simulations with both the flight data collected during the rocket launch and the results of the simulation run in \texttt{OpenRocket}.

To do so, we have coded in \texttt{MATLAB} a simple model that simulate the dynamics of the rocket flight, which takes into account drag force, gravity, thrust force and mass reduction due to the fuel consumption.
