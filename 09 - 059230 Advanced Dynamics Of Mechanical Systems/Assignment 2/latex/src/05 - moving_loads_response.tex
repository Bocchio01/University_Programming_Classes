\section{Response due to moving loads}
\label{sec:moving_loads_response}

Finally, we can simulate a real working condition for the harbour crane, by applying a moving load on the structure.

In particular, we can consider a mass of $m = 45[T] = 45E3 [Kg]$ moving along the crane's arm, starting in correspondence of node \textbf{D} and moving towards node \textbf{A} (tip of the arm crane).
