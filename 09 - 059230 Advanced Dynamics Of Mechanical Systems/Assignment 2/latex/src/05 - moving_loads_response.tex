\section{Response due to moving loads}
\label{sec:moving_loads_response}

Finally, we can simulate a real working condition for the harbour crane, by applying a moving load on the structure.

In particular, we can consider a mass of $m = 45[T]$ moving along the $x$ axis, starting from the correspondence of node \textbf{\#7} and moving towards node \textbf{\#9} (tip of the arm crane).
