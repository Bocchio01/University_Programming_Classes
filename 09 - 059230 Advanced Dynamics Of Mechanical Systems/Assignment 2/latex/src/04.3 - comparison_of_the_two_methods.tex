\subsection{Comparison of the two methods}
\label{subsec:comparison_of_the_two_methods}

As we can see from Figure \ref{fig:static_responses}, the two methods give the same results.
This is expected given that the acceleration approach is just a derivation of the displacement approach, since the mass matrices $M$ and the stiffness matrices $K$ are just an implementation of the displacement and/or the force method used to solve structures.
