\section{FRFs of the structure}
\label{sec:FRFs}

Once the model has been defined and the natural frequencies and mode shapes have been calculated, the next step is to compute the Frequency Response Functions (FRFs) of the structure.
The FRFs are a fundamental tool in the analysis of dynamic systems, as they provide a quantitative measure of the system's response to an external excitation as a function of frequency.
