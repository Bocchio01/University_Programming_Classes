\section{FE model}
\label{sec:FE_model}

In the following subsections, we will describe the Finite Element Model (FEM) of the harbour crane and discuss some key aspects of the model, such as the geometry and material properties and the assembly of the mass and stiffness matrices.
We will also discuss the results obtained from the modal analysis of the system.
