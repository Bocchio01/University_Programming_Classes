\section{Static responses of the structure}
\label{sec:static_responses}

In this section, we will focus on the computation of the static responses of the structure, that are the displacements of the structure when subjected to a static load.

Again, as in many other engineering problems, we can approach this problem in at least a couple of different ways.
In the following, we will explain how to compute the static responses of the structure using both a displacement approach and an acceleration approach.

Notice that the two method differs only in the way the global force vector $\mathbf{F_F}$ is assembled.
In the end, once $\mathbf{F_F}$ is known, both methods will solve the steady state version of the equation of motion:

\begin{equation}
    [K_{FF}] \mathbf{X_F} = \mathbf{F_F}
    \label{eq:static_responses}
\end{equation}

Where $[K_{FF}]$ is the stiffness matrix, $\mathbf{X_F}$ is the vector of displacements and $\mathbf{F_F}$ is the global force vector, all referred to the free degrees of freedom of the nodes.
