\subsection{Computation of natural frequencies}
\label{subsec:natural_frequencies}

From theory, we know that the natural frequencies of a system can be computed by solving the following equation:

\begin{equation}
    det[H(\omega_n)] = 0
\end{equation}

Where $H(\omega_n)$ is the matrix as reported in Equation \ref{eq:linear_system} and $\omega_n$ is one of the natural frequencies.

By iterating over a given vector of frequencies, we can compute the value of the determinant of the matrix $H(\omega)$ and find the minimums, which correspond to the natural frequencies of the system.

The result of this computation is shown in Figure \ref{fig:natural_frequencies}.
