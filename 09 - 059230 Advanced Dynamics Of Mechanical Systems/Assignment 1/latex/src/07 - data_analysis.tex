\section{Data Analysis}
\label{sec:data_analysis}

In this section, the data collected during the experimental campaign are analyzed.
The data are processed exactly as described in the previous section (see Section \ref{sec:parameters_identification}), and the identified parameters are used to compute the numerical FRFs and so the mode shapes of the system.

In particular, by plotting the given data (which are the experimental FRFs and their coherence functions), we can clearly see that multiple peaks are present (see Figure \ref{fig:FRFs_part_B}).
However, this study will be focused on the first two peaks only, given that considering the real system from which data are acquired, those are the one of interest.
