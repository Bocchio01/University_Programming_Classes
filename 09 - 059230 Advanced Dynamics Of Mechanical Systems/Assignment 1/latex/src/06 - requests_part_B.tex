\label{sec:requests_part_B}

The requests for `Assignment 1 (Part B)' are the followings:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Apply the procedure developed within Part A to the provided experimental data, to identify the modal parameters (natural frequencies, damping ratios and mode shapes) of the first two axial modes.
    \item Check the quality of the identification comparing the identified FRFs and the experimental ones.
    \item Plot a diagram showing the identified mode shapes with the indication of the corresponding natural frequencies and damping ratios.
\end{itemize}
