\section{Requests (Part A)}
\label{sec:requests_part_A}

The requests for `Assignment 1 (Part A)' are the followings:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Briefly describe the procedure followed for computing natural frequencies and mode shapes. Plot the mode shapes of the first four modes with the indication of the associated natural frequencies and provide comments to the results.
    \item Compute the FRFs for some combinations of input and output positions. Comment the results.
    \item Briefly describe the procedure followed for identifying the natural frequencies, damping ratios and mode shapes of the first four modes, relying on the FRF-based multi-mode curve fitting method (n = 1).
    \item Check the quality of the identification comparing the identified FRFs and the ones numerically computed.
    \item Compare the parameters defined at the simulation stage to the identified ones. Collect the results in table form and plot a diagram showing the comparison of the simulated and identified mode shapes.
\end{itemize}
