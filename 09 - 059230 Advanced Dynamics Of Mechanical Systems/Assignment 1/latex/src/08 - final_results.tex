\section{Final Results (mode shapes visualization)}
\label{sec:final_results_B}

In this section, the mode shapes identified from the experimental data are reported.

These graphs represent axial displacements relative to the undeformed system.
The farther the colored lines are from the black dashed line, the greater the axial deformation in that region.
Additionally, the position of the colored lines relative to the black dashed line (either outside or inside) indicates the direction of the deformation with respect to the undeformed plane of the system.

The first mode shape (Figure \ref{fig:mode_shapes}, left) can also be visualized in a 3D way that to a FEA simulation performed in \cite{FEM_rail_wheel}.

As a final remark, we report in Table \ref{tab:mode_shapes_parameters} the identified parameters for the first two mode shapes of the system.
